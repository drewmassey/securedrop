Internationalization (i18n)
===========================

The code, templates and JavaScript user visible strings must all be
wrapped with `gettext`_ functions to be substituted with the
equivalent localized string. For instance:

.. code:: python

     if not (msg or fh):
       flash(gettext("You must enter a message or choose a file to submit."), "error")
       return redirect(url_for('main.lookup'))

The ``gettext`` function reads ``.mo`` files to find the translation
for the string given in argument at runtime. It is used as a marker by
`pybabel <http://babel.pocoo.org/>`__ or similar tools to collect the
strings to be translated and store them into a `.pot
<https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#index-files_002c-_002epot>`__
file at ``securedrop/translations/messages.pot``. For instance:

::

    #: source_app/main.py:111
    msgid "You must enter a message or choose a file to submit."
    msgstr ""

For each language
to be translated, a directory is created such as
``securedrop/translations/fr_FR`` and populated
with a `.po <https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#PO-Files>`__ file
derived from ``securedrop/translations/messages.pot``, for translators to work
with. For instance
``securedrop/translations/fr_FR/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`` is almost identical to
``securedrop/translations/messages.pot`` except for the `msgstr`
field which contains the translation:

::

    #: source_app/main.py:111
    msgid "You must enter a message or choose a file to submit."
    msgstr "Vous devez saisir un message ou sélectionner un fichier à envoyer."

This file is compiled into an optimized binary form, the `.mo
<https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#MO-Files>`__
file used by the `gettext`_ function at runtime.

The `Weblate`_ web application is used to translate strings and relies
on the `gettext`_ format behind the scene. It owns the
``securedrop/translations/messages.pot`` file and all other
translation related files. The SecureDrop code is modified by sending
a pull request but the translations are exclusively modified via
`Weblate`_.

The desktop icon are in the
``install_files/ansible-base/roles/tails-config/templates`` directory.
Their labels are collected in the ``desktop.pot`` file and translated
in the corresponding ``.po`` files in the same directory (``fr.po``,
``de.po`` etc.). All translations are merged from the ``*.j2.in``
files into the corresponding ``*.j2`` file and committed to the repository.
They are then installed when configuring Tails with
the ``tasks/create_desktop_shortcuts.yml`` tasks.

The i18n_tool.py Translation Helpers
------------------------------------

The `pybabel`_ and `gettext`_ command line is wrapped into the
``i18n_tool.py translate-messages`` and ``i18n_tool.py translate-desktop``
helpers for convenience. It is designed to be used by developers, to
run tests with fixtures and for packaging.

Creating New Translations
-------------------------

A user with weblate admin rights must visit the
`Weblate translation creation page`_ and the `Weblate desktop translation creation page`_
to add the desired languages.

Updating Strings to be Translated
---------------------------------

After strings are modified in the code, templates, JavaScript or desktop
labels, the ``securedrop/translations/messages.pot`` files must also be
updated. Individual developers should NOT do this when changing strings
in the code; the translations will be updated in bulk later on.

Translations can be updated with the following command:

.. code:: sh

    make translate

This wraps ``i18n_tool.py translate-messages`` and ``i18n_tool.py
translate-desktop``.  These commands will update
``securedrop/translations/messages.pot``,
``install_files/ansible-base/roles/tails-config/templates/desktop.pot``,
and the ``messages.po`` files for each language.

.. note:: The changes will only be visible in the `Weblate`_ web
   interface used by translators after :ref:`merging_develop_into_the_weblate_fork`.

Compiling Translations
----------------------

`gettext`_ needs a compiled file for each language (the ``*.mo``
files). This can be done by running the following command:

.. code:: sh

    securedrop/bin/dev-shell ./i18n_tool.py --verbose translate-messages --compile

For desktop files the compilation phases creates a modified version of
the original file which includes all the translations collected from
the ``.po`` files.

This can be done by running the following command::

    securedrop/bin/dev-shell ./i18n_tool.py --verbose translate-desktop --compile

Verifying Translations
----------------------

After a translation is compiled, the web page in which it shows can be
verified visually by navigating to the corresponding state from
``http://localhost:8080`` for the source interface or
``http://localhost:8081`` for the journalist interface after running
the following:

.. code:: sh

     make -C securedrop dev

An easier way is to generate screenshots for each desired language
with:

.. code:: sh

     $ securedrop/bin/dev-shell bash
     $ export PAGE_LAYOUT_LOCALES=en_US,fr_FR
     $ ./i18n_tool.py --verbose translate-messages --compile
     $ pytest -v --page-layout tests/pageslayout
     ...
     ...TestJournalistLayout::test_col_no_documents[en_US] PASSED
     ...TestJournalistLayout::test_col_no_documents[fr_FR] PASSED
     ...

.. note:: if unset, PAGE_LAYOUT_LOCALES defaults to en_US

The screenshots for ``fr_FR`` are available in
``securedrop/tests/pageslayout/screenshots/fr_FR`` and the name of
the file can be found in the function that created it in
``securedrop/tests/pageslayout/test_journalist.py`` or
``securedrop/tests/pageslayout/test_source.py``.

Merging Translations Back to Develop
------------------------------------

`Weblate`_ automatically pushes the translations done via the web
interface as a series of commits to the ``i18n`` branch in the `Weblate
SecureDrop branch`_ which is a fork of the ``develop`` branch of the
`SecureDrop git repository`_. These translations need to be submitted
to the ``develop`` branch via pull requests for merge on a regular basis.
Branches to merge translations should be prefixed with ``i18n-`` so that
the translation tests will run in CircleCI.

SecureDrop only supports a subset of all the languages being worked on
in `Weblate`_: some of them are partially translated or not fully
reviewed. The list of supported languages is hard-coded in the
``i18n_tool.py`` file, in the ``SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`` variable. When a
new language is fully translated and reviewed, the ``i18n_tool.py``
file must be manually edited to add this new language to the
``SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`` variable.

.. code:: sh

      $ git clone https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop
      $ cd securedrop
      $ git checkout -b i18n-merge origin/develop
      $ securedrop/bin/dev-shell ./i18n_tool.py --verbose update-from-weblate
      $ securedrop/bin/dev-shell ./i18n_tool.py --verbose translate-desktop --compile
      $ securedrop/bin/dev-shell ./i18n_tool.py --verbose update-docs
      $ git commit -m 'l10n: compile desktop files' translations # if needed
      $ git push i18n-merge # and make a pull request from the branch

.. warning::

   It is **very** important to carefully check each translated string
   does not look strange. Even if the reviewer does not understand the
   language, if a translated string looks strange, someone other than
   the reviewer must be consulted to verify it means something. It is
   extremely unlikely that a reviewer will manipulate a translated
   string to introduce a vulnerability in SecureDrop. But it is easy to
   check visually and significantly reduce the risk.

List contributors for each supported language:

.. code:: sh

      $ for l in $sm ; do echo -n "$l " ; git log --format=%aN lab/i18n -- install_files/ansible-base/roles/tails-config/templates/$l.po securedrop/translations/$l/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po | sort -u | tr '\n' ',' | sed -e 's/,/, /g' ; echo ; done
      nl Anne M, kwadronaut, Yarno Ritzen,
      fr Alain-Olivier,
      ...

Verify the translations are not broken:

.. code:: sh

      $ securedrop/bin/dev-shell ./i18n_tool.py --verbose translate-messages --compile
      $ PAGE_LAYOUT_LOCALES=$(echo $sm | tr ' ' ',') \
          pytest -v --page-layout tests/pageslayout

.. note:: The CI job ``translation-tests`` will run the above page layout tests
          in all supported languages on branches named with the prefix ``i18n-``.

Go to https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop and propose a pull request.

.. note:: contrary to the applications translations, the desktop
          translations are compiled and merged into the
          repository. They need to be available in their translated
          form when ``securedrop-admin tailsconfig`` is run because
          the development environment is not available.

.. _merging_develop_into_the_weblate_fork:

Merging Develop into the Weblate Fork
-------------------------------------

`Weblate`_ works on a long standing fork of the `SecureDrop git
repository`_ and is exclusively responsible for the content of the
``*.pot`` and ``*.po`` files. The content of the
``develop`` branch must be merged into the ``i18n`` branch to extract
new strings to translate or existing strings that were updated.

The translations must be suspended in `Weblate`_ to avoid conflicts.

* Go to the `Weblate commit page for SecureDrop`_

|Weblate commit Lock|

* Click ``Commit``
* Click ``Push`` (we do these two steps, so that uncommitted changes
  in the repo do not create merge conflicts.)
* And finally, click ``Lock``

|Weblate commit Locked|

The ``develop`` branch can now be merged into ``i18n`` as follows:

.. code:: sh

      $ git clone https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop
      $ cd securedrop
      $ git remote add lab git@github.com:freedomofpress/securedrop-i18n.git
      $ git fetch lab
      $ git checkout -b i18n lab/i18n
      $ git merge origin/develop
      $ make -C securedrop translate

The ``translate`` Makefile target relies on the ``i18n_tool.py`` command
to examine all the source files, looking for strings that need to be
translated (i.e. ``gettext('translate me')`` etc.)  and update the
``*.pot`` and ``*.po`` files, removing, updating and inserting strings
to keep them in sync with the sources. Carefully review the output of
``git diff``. Check ``messages.pot`` first for updated strings,
looking for formatting problems. Then review the ``messages.po`` of
one existing translation, with a focus on ``fuzzy``
translations. There is no need to review other translations because
they are processed in the same way. When you are satisfied with the
result, it can be merged with:

.. code:: sh

      $ git commit -a -m 'l10n: sync with upstream origin/develop'
      $ git push lab i18n


* Go to the `Weblate commit page for SecureDrop`_ and verify the
  commit hash matches the last commit of the ``i18n`` branch. This must
  happen instantly after the branch is pushed because Weblate is
  notified via a webhook. If it is different,
  `ask for help <https://gitter.im/freedomofpress/securedrop>`__.

* Click ``Unlock``

|Weblate commit Unlock|

`Weblate`_ pushes the translations done via the web interface
to the develop branch in a fork of the `SecureDrop git repository`_.
These commits must be manually cherry-picked and proposed as pull
requests for the `SecureDrop git repository`_.

|Weblate commit Unlocked|

Updating the Full Text Index
----------------------------

The full text index can occasionally not be up to date. The symptom
may be that the search function fails to find a word that you know
exists in the source strings. If that happens you can rebuild the
index from scratch with:

.. code:: sh

      $ ssh debian@weblate.securedrop.org
      $ cd /app/weblate
      $ sudo docker-compose run weblate rebuild_index --all --clean

Note that the new index will not be used right away, some workers may
still have the old index open. Rebooting the machine is an option,
waiting for a few hours is another option.

.. _i18n_release:

Release Management
------------------

Two Weeks Before the Release: Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new and updated strings are uploaded to Weblate. This is done late in the SecureDrop release cycle so translators get less notifications. It would be inconvenient if there were hundreds of strings needing attention. But SecureDrop is small and it is ok to postpone notifications.

* Merge develop into the Weblate fork
* Post an announcement `to the translation section of the forum <https://forum.securedrop.org/c/translations>`__ (see `an example  <https://forum.securedrop.org/t/10-securedrop-strings-need-work-february-2018-feature-freeze/449>`__)
* Add a prominent Weblate whiteboard announcement that reads `The X.Y.Z deadline is MM DD, YY midnight. String freeze will be in effect MM DD, YY midnight.`
* Create a pull request for every source string suggestion coming from translators
* Backport every commit changing a source string to the release branch
* Update the `i18n timeline`_ and `Weblate whiteboard`_

One Week Before the Release: String Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Verify develop and the release branch have the same source strings
* Merge develop into the Weblate fork
* Post an announcement `to the translation section of the forum <https://forum.securedrop.org/c/translations>`__ (see `an example  <https://forum.securedrop.org/t/4-securedrop-strings-need-work-march-2018-string-freeze/461>`__)
* Remind all developers about the string freeze, in the `chat room <https://gitter.im/freedomofpress/securedrop>`__
* Add a prominent Weblate whiteboard announcement that reads `The X.Y.Z deadline is Month day, year midnight. String freeze is in effect: no source string are modified before the release.`
* Update the `i18n timeline`_ and `Weblate whiteboard`_

The Day of the Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Merge translations back to develop
* :ref:`Update the screenshots <updating_screenshots>`
* Remove the prominent Weblate whiteboard announcement
* Provide translator credits to add to the SecureDrop release announcement
* Update the `i18n timeline`_ and `Weblate whiteboard`_

Translator Credits
------------------

Verify the names and emails look ok, otherwise add to `.mailmap
<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-mailmap>`__ until it does:

.. code:: sh

      $ git clone https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop
      $ cd securedrop
      $ git remote add lab git@github.com:freedomofpress/securedrop-i18n.git
      $ git fetch lab
      $ previous_version=0.4.4
      $ git log --pretty='%aN <%aE>' $previous_version..lab/i18n -- \
         securedrop/translations install_files/ansible-base/roles/tails-config/templates | sort -u

We do not want to publish the translator emails so we strip them:

.. code:: sh

       git log --pretty='%aN' $previous_version..lab/i18n -- \
        securedrop/translations install_files/ansible-base/roles/tails-config/templates | sort -u

.. _i18n-administrator-permissions:

Translations Admins
-------------------

.. note:: The privilege escalation workflow is different for
          :ref:`code maintainers <contributor-permissions>` and
          :ref:`translation maintainers <i18n-administrator-permissions>`.

A translation admin is a person who is actively performing
administrative duties. They have special permissions on the
repositories and the translation platform. When someone is willing to
become an admin, a thread is started in `the translation
section of the forum
<https://forum.securedrop.org/c/translations>`_. If there is a
consensus, the permissions of the new admin are elevated after
a week or more. If there is no consensus, a public vote is organized
among the current admins.

All admins are listed in the `forum introduction page
<https://forum.securedrop.org/t/about-the-translations-category/16/1>`_

The privileges of an admin who has not been active for six months
or more are revoked. They can apply again at any time.

The community of SecureDrop translators works very closely with the
SecureDrop developers and some of them participate in both
groups. However, the translators community has a different set of
rules and permissions, reason why it makes sense to have an
independent policy.

Admin Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An admin may not need or want all permissions but they are
entitled to have all of them.

* https://weblate.securedrop.org/admin/auth/user/ grant staff and superuser status
* https://forum.securedrop.org/admin/users/list/active click on the user and ``Grant Moderation``
* https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-i18n make sure that the user has commit access

Granting Reviewer Privileges in Weblate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* visit https://weblate.securedrop.org/admin/auth/user/
* click on the user name
* in the ``Groups`` block
    * select ``Localizationlab`` in the ``Available groups`` list and
      click on the right arrow to move it to the ``Chosen groups``
      list
    * select ``Users`` in the ``Chosen groups`` list and click on the
      left arrow to remove it
